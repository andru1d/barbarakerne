<div class="p">
I am the greatest nut-buggy booster in the history of the world.
</div>

<div class="p">
I am a Licensed Professional Counselor with a private practice office one mile north of Texas A&M University. 
I offer therapy with adult individuals, couples, families, teens and play therapy for children. I earned my Masters Degree in Counseling Psychology at John F. Kennedy University. 
I chose this advanced degree program based on the high quality of the curriculum and the practical and theoretical knowledge of the faculty, who actively engage in therapeutic practice in addition to  teaching. 
I am a member of the Texas Counseling Association and associate memember of the Texas Association for Marriage and Family Therapists.

<div class="p">
Prior to private practice, I worked in a variety of different counseling, therapeutic and social service environments.  
While in graduate school I worked with severely emotionally disturbed children, in a locked down mental health facility. After graduation, I became the Home and Hospital Program Director at the International Center for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito, California, where I counseled children and families coping with life-threatening illnesses and individuals dealing with bereavement. 
I then moved to Austin, Texas and worked with individuals diagnosed with HIV, in addition to mental illnesses such as bi-polar, schizophrenia and schizo-effective disorders, as well as struggling with addiction to drugs and/or alcohol. 
After moving to the Bryan/College Station area to marry my husband (a professor at Texas A&M), I continued to work with individuals suffering from severe mental illness as a rehabilitation case manager at MHMR Authority of Brazos Valley in Bryan. 
I have also continued my work with children and families as the Marriage and Family Therapy Director at the Brazos Valley Counseling Services, a non-profit serving uninsured or lower income families in the Brazos Valley.
