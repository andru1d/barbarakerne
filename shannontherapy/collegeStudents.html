<div class="p">
Going to college is exciting.
You experience many new things.
This can be challenging!
</div>
<div class="p" style="margin-left:90px;">
<li>One might find that while high school was relatively easy, and being at the top of the class was not that difficult, it is quite another thing in college. <br/>Hopes for medical school or another particular career may seem difficult to accomplish. 
</li>
<li>Maybe you have discovered that you are an artist, writer or other career far from what your parents expect of you.</li>
<li>You may also be grappling with your sexual orientation. </li>
<li>Maybe it isn't school work that is troubling you, but your social life. <br/>
Maybe you are feeling rejected and left out. 
Finding the right friends isn't always easy. 
<li>Through changes, maybe  friends from freshmen year aren't who you connect with now. </li>
<li>Maybe you have been impacted by a life crisis such as your parents' divorce, a death in the family, or other life stressors.</li>
</div>
<div class="p">
If you are suffering from depression or anxiety, my goal will be to help you find your way back to feeling yourself through therapy.
Early adulthood is a time when mental illness can take hold, such as bipolar, or schizophrenia. 
I can help you be properly diagnosed, and collaborate with a physician for your medication treatment.
Other school and medical resources can also be accessed with my help. 
</div>
<div class="p">
I love counseling young adults. 
It is a time of great discovery. 
With this can come psychological growing pains unique to you and to your age. 
I am interested to know who you are, and who you are struggling to become. 
I relish this time with you. I hope to facilitate your growth.
