<div class="p">
I am a Licensed Professional Counselor with a private practice office one mile north of Texas A&amp;M University. 
I offer therapy with adult individuals, couples, families, teens, and play therapy for children. I earned my Masters Degree in the esteemed Counseling Psychology program at John F. Kennedy University. 
I am a member of the  
Texas Counseling Association
and the 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://www.a4pt.org/ps.index.cfm?ID=1653">Association for Play Therapists</a>, 
and an associate member of the
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://www.tamft.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=20">Texas Association for Marriage and Family Therapists</a>.
</div>

<div class="p">
I am deeply humbled and rewarded as a therapist at the sublime moments when I facilitate processes of self-discovery and healing. 
Whether I am working with adults, couples, whole families, teens, or children, I offer a warm, empathic approach. I believe in the power of acceptance and laughter to heal. 
</div>

<div class="p">
I previously worked with severely emotionally disturbed children. 
Then, I served as the Home and Hospital Program Director at the International Center for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito, California. 
I counseled children and families coping with life-threatening illnesses and individuals dealing with bereavement. 
In Austin, I worked at MHMR, providing care to clients with multiple diagnoses, including HIV and addictions. 
</div>

<div class="p">
I moved to the Bryan/College Station area to marry my husband, a professor at Texas A&amp;M.
I worked with individuals suffering from severe mental illness as rehabilitation case manager at MHMR in Bryan. 
</div>

<div class="p">
I co-founded Brazos Valley Counseling Services, a non-profit serving under-insured and lower income families in the Brazos Valley.
I worked with children and families, serving as Marriage and Family Therapy Director.
I was featured in an <a class="destination" target="blank" href="images/shannonTaylorPsychotherapyBrazosFamily2010.pdf">article in Brazos Family magazine</a>.
</div>

<div class="p">
I serve community in times of disaster.
In response to the San Francisco Area earthquake, I established and coordinated the relief intervention and peer counseling area in an American Red Cross shelter. 
I provided support for children and families processing emotional and physical trauma (e.g. loss of dwellings/personal property/pets/loved ones) due to natural disaster.
I provided crisis debriefing for caregivers and first responders to the Oklahoma Federal Building Bombing Disaster. 
I helped establish peer crisis counseling for children &amp; teens at elementary, middle, &amp; high schools.</div>
