<div class="p">
Many parents want to bring their teens in for counseling so that their teen can be "fixed". 
While I understand the sentiment, and sympathize with that, "I want to tear my hair out," feeling, counseling is a different process.

</div>
<div class="p">
Behavior problems in teens can feel almost impossible to deal with. 
Sometimes your once loving relationship can break down into what feels only like a power struggle, with little love and respect transferred from child to parent and parent to child. 
Your once calm household can feel as if it is the secret site of World War III. 
</div>
<div class="p">
I will be asking you, the parents, to look inside yourselves and make changes necessary to meet your child on uncharted parental and emotional territory.
As your child begins to grow into an adult and deal with life issues, risks and decisions, we will work to help you develop a new set of parenting and communication skills.  
</div>
<div class="p">
I set a safe and confidential space for your teen to talk and grapple with issues and problems. 
Some appointments may include one or both of the parents, or even your whole family. 
This way, you are kept in the loop. The focus of therapy is also to insure a better, happier and more communicative relationship with your teen. 
</div>
<div class="p">
I work with adolescents and teens to support their journey to adulthood. 
I use a combination of expressive arts, interactive exercises, outdoor activities, <a class="destination" href="sandTray.html">Sandtray [The World Technique]</a> and talk therapy. 
Teens build greater self-esteem. They find ways to solve problems. They learn to deal with social networking, and all sorts of pressures from this technological age. 
I will help teens learn and utilize coping and social skills for healthy development and emotional growth.
