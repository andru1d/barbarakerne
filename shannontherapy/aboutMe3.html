</div>

<div class="holder">

<div class="p">
I am a Licensed Professional Counselor with a private practice office one mile north of Texas A&M University. 
I offer therapy with adult individuals, couples, families, teens, and play therapy for children. I earned my Masters Degree in the esteemed Counseling Psychology program at John F. Kennedy University. 
<!-- I chose this advanced degree program based on the high quality of the curriculum and the practical and theoretical knowledge of the faculty, who actively engage in therapeutic practice in addition to  teaching.  -->
I am a member of the  
Texas Counseling Association
and the 
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://www.a4pt.org/ps.index.cfm?ID=1653">Association for Play Therapists</a>, 
and an associate member of the
<a target="_blank" class="destination" href="http://www.tamft.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=20">Texas Association for Marriage and Family Therapists</a>.
</div>

<div class="p">
I am deeply humbled and rewarded as a therapist at the sublime moments when I facilitate processes of self-discovery and healing. 
Whether I am working with adults, couples, whole families, teens, or children, I offer a warm, empathic approach. I believe in the power of acceptance and laughter to heal. 
</div>

<div class="p">
Prior to private practice, I worked in a variety of different counseling, therapeutic, and social service environments.  
While in graduate school I worked with severely emotionally disturbed children, in a locked down mental health facility. 
After graduation, I served as the Home and Hospital Program Director at the International Center for Attitudinal Healing in Sausalito, California, where I counseled children and families coping with life-threatening illnesses and individuals dealing with bereavement. 
</div>

<div class="p">
In 2007, I moved to Austin, Texas and worked at MHMR's CARE program, providing care to clients with multiple diagnoses.
All had HIV.
Some were struggling with addiction to drugs and/or alcohol. 
Mental illnesses included bi-polar, schizophrenia, and schizo-effective disorders.
</div>

<div class="p">
After moving to the Bryan/College Station area to marry my husband (a professor at Texas A&M), I continued to work with individuals suffering from severe mental illness as rehabilitation case manager at MHMR Authority of Brazos Valley in Bryan. 
</div>

<div class="p">
I co-founded Brazos Valley Counseling Services, a non-profit serving under-insured and lower income families in the Brazos Valley.
I continue to work with children and families there, serving as Marriage and Family Therapy Director.
</div>

<div class="p">
I have worked to provide crisis support to major national disasters.
In response to the San Francisco Area earthquake, I established and coordinated the relief intervention and peer counseling area in an American Red Cross shelter. 
I provided support for children and families processing emotional and physical trauma (e.g. loss of dwellings/personal property/pets/loved ones) due to natural disaster.


<div class="p">
I was a member of The International Center For Attitudinal Healing team that provided crisis debriefing for caregivers and first responders to the Oklahoma Federal Building Bombing Disaster. 
We established peer crisis counseling for children & teens at elementary, middle, & high schools.</div>
